# config for high-resolution MFCC features, intended for neural network training
# Note: we keep all cepstra, so it has the same info as filterbank features,
# but MFCC is more easily compressible (because less correlated) which is why 
# we prefer this method.
--use-energy=false   # use average of log energy, not energy.
--num-mel-bins=40     # similar to Google's setup.
--num-ceps=40     # there is no dimensionality reduction.
